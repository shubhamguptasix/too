                        "roleInDisease": "Loss of tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers. (Brown C et al., 2009; 19935675). Carriers of a germline mutation in TP53 have Li-Fraumeni Syndrome, an inherited cancer syndrome resulting in multiple tumors in early adulthood, including breast cancer, brain tumors, and leukemias. (Malkin D et al., 1990; 1978757, Srivastava S et al., 1991; 2259385, Santib'e1'f1ez-Koref M et al., 1991; 1683921). Expression of p53 in normal cells is low; however, TP53 alterations, including those that result in loss of p53 tumor suppressor function, may lead to stabilization and increased expression of p53, particularly in the nucleus, and several studies have shown that it may have oncogenic gain-of-function effects. (Wang Y et al., 2005; 15625370, Koga T et al., 2001; 11400116, Kato S et al., 2003; 12826609, Houben R et al., 2011; 21760960, Olivier M et al., 2009; 18802452). TP53 alterations are believed to be early events in NSCLC, preceding lymph node metastasis. (Chang Y et al., 2011; 20811949). TP53 mutation and expression of p53 have been correlated with the lung squamous cell carcinoma subtype, and p53 expression in lung squamous cell carcinoma has also been associated with disease stage and higher grade tumors. (Jiang R et al., 2020; 32034196, Mattioni M et al., 2015; 25884692, Bircan A et al., 2010; 20349288, Kim Y et al., 2014; 24323028). TP53 mutation has been associated with PD-L1 expression and T-cell infiltration in lung adenocarcinoma samples. (Dong Z et al., 2017; 28039262, Scheel A et al., 2016; 27467949, Albitar M et al., 2018; 29568386, Mansuet-Lupo A et al., 2016; 27299180, Kadara H et al., 2017; 27687306).",

Therapeutic approaches under investigation include gene therapy for TP53 and (dendritic cell-based) TP53 vaccines.

Inhibition of components of the DNA damage checkpoint, including Checkpoint Kinase 1 (Chk1) and Wee1, has been reported to enhance the activity of DNA-damaging agents in preclinical cancer models with deficiency of p53 function. (Ma C et al., 2011; 21087899, Hirai H et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges K et al., 2011; 21799033). Clinical trials of the Wee1 inhibitor adavosertib (MK-1775) are currently underway for patients with solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Studies have reported Aurora kinase A to be activated in cells harboring TP53 mutation, and Aurora kinase A and B inhibitors have been reported to activate wild-type p53 in cellular assays; thus, tumors retaining a wild-type TP53 allele may benefit from Aurora kinase inhibitors. (Vilgelm A et al., 2015; 25398437, Li Z et al., 2015; 25512615, Katayama H et al., 2011; 21761334, Tentler J et al., 2015; 25758253, Gully C et al., 2012; 22611192, Marxer M et al., 2014; 23955083).",

TP53 is a tumor suppressor that encodes the p53 protein; alterations in TP53 may result in a loss of p53 function, yet an increase in the expression and stability of the mutant p53 protein in the nucleus, sometimes leading to oncogenic effects, including genomic instability and excessive cell proliferation (Levine, 1997; 9039259, Wang et al., 2005; 15625370, Koga et al., 2001; 11400116, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Houben et al., 2011; 21760960, Olivier et al., 2009; 18802452).

Aurora kinase A inhibitors are another therapeutic approach under investigation for TP53-mutated cancers (Vilgelm et al., 2015; 25398437, Li et al., 2015; 25512615, Katayama and Sen, 2011; 21761334, Tentler et al., 2015; 25758253, Kalous et al., 2013; 24091768).",

DBD mutations are thought to result in loss of function via the loss of transactivation of p53-dependent genes (Kato et al., 2003; 12826609). The tetramerization domain is thought to be critical to normal p53 function (Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130). In addition, this alteration is likely to elicit nonsense-mediated decay (Lindeboom et al., 2016; 27618451, Popp and Maquat, 2018; 29121514, Nagy and Maquat, 1998; 9644970, Richards et al., 2015; 25741868).

TP53 is one of the most commonly mutated genes in lung cancer; scientific studies have reported TP53 mutations in 27-46% of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cases (M'e4ki-Nevala et al., 2016; 27565922, Jiang et al., 2020; 32034196, Tamiya et al., 2020; 32022477, Ma et al., 2014; 24495481)."
